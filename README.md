# Machine-Learning
Scripts for training and testing machine learning models based on Sefaria's data

## Setup

### Install Local DBManager package

There is a local python package included in this repo which contains utility functions and classes for interfacing with Prodigy. These utilities are also used for defining the interface between Mongo and spaCy so they are required to install before running any training tasks.

To install, follow instructions in `prodigy/prodigy_package/README.txt`.
